## Description
The Business Analytics Student Survey is a web-based form designed to gather information from students regarding their demographics, impressions of the Business Analytics major, and other relevant data.

## Best Practices for Forms
In crafting the form, I focused on adhering to best practices to ensure a seamless user experience. Each section of the form, encapsulated within `<div>` elements with clear class names like `.question`, maintains a consistent and organized structure, aiding users in navigating through the survey effortlessly. I meticulously chose appropriate input types such as text fields and dropdown menus to match the nature of the information being collected, promoting user efficiency and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Furthermore, I prioritized user input validation by marking essential fields as required, thus prompting users to provide necessary information upfront. This approach not only minimizes incomplete submissions but also streamlines the form-filling process. Additionally, by employing semantic HTML elements and providing clear labels, I ensured that the form is accessible to all users, including those relying on assistive technologies. These efforts underscore my commitment to user-centric design and inclusivity, fostering a positive interaction environment for all users.

## User Accessibility
In designing the form, I integrated several features to enhance accessibility for all users. One key aspect was providing clear and descriptive labels for each input field, ensuring that screen readers can accurately convey the purpose of each form element to visually impaired users. Additionally, I utilized semantic HTML elements and proper document structure to facilitate navigation and comprehension for users relying on assistive technologies.
